description: "Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more Virtual Networks in Azure. The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure. Like traffic between virtual machines in the same network, traffic is routed through Microsoft's private network only."

Use this field if the remote VNet isn't managed by Massdriver or exists in a different subscription than the requester VNet. The CIDRs of the requester and accepter VNets **must not overlap**."
